Originally named "Project Optimus" and started in March 2021 by [Ryan
Price](https://github.com/ryapric), OpenSourceCorp (OSC) was first intended as a
dumping ground for [all of Ryan's own disparate, growing code
repos](https://github.com/ryapric?tab=repositories). As he started to add new
codebases, he thought it might be more valuable to readers to try organizing the
content into something more cohesive. After a lot of spooling on how that might
look & act, OSC was publicly announced in July 2021.

You can read about the motivations for OSC on [the homepage](/).
