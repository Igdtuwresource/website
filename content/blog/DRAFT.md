This document is a living draft of changes across OSC to put into bllog posts.
It should remain in `draft` mode in the front matter, and as such can be
committed to source control without appearing on the site.

Updates
-------

* `osc-infra` subsystems have been renamed across the board
* `rhad` is totally redone
* Website is LIVE, but janky except for blog posts
* We have a WIP logo!
