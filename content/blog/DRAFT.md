This document is a living draft of changes across OSC to put into blog posts. It
should remain in `draft` mode in the front matter, and as such can be committed
to source control without appearing on the site.

Updates
-------

* `osc-infra` subsystems have been renamed across the board
* `rhad` is totally redone
* Website is LIVE, but janky except for blog posts
  * We even have a WIP logo!
* osc-infra tweaks for memory & disk concerns
